## PROJECT DETAILS
- The ever-increasing exposure of kids and young adults to the realm of social media has made it disturbingly easy to be subjected to textual abuse through messaging platforms.
- Our aim is to provide a solution for this issue in the form of an application which acts as an effective filter for toxic messages.
- To actively apply efficient Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms with deep learning to perform text filtering and deploy the model to merge the filtering functionality with messaging applications.
